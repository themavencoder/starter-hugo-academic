summary: The objective of this study is to verify the anatomic correlate of the
  second (2nd) outer retina band in optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to
  demonstrate the potential of using intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging for
  concurrent optoretinography (ORG) of phototransduction activation and energy
  metabolism in stimulus activated retinal photoreceptors. A custom-designed OCT
  was employed for depth-resolved IOS imaging in mouse retina activated by a
  visible light flicker stimulation. The spatiotemporal properties of the IOS
  changes at the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) and inner segment (IS) were
  quantitatively evaluated. Rapid IOS change was observed at the OS almost right
  away, and the IOS at the IS was relatively slow. Comparative analysis
  indicates that the OS-IOS reflects transient OS deformation caused by the
  phototransduction activation, and IS-IOS might reflect the energy metabolism
  caused by mitochondria activation in retinal photoreceptors. The consistency
  of the distribution of the IS-IOS and the 2nd OCT band supports the IS
  ellipsoid (ISe), which has abundant mitochondria, as the signal source of the
  2nd OCT band of the outer retina.

The paper titled “In vivo optoretinography of phototransduction activation and energy metabolism in retinal photoreceptors” was published in the Journal of Biophotonics in 2021. The objective of this study was to verify the anatomic correlate of the second outer retina band in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to demonstrate the potential of using intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging for concurrent optoretinography (ORG) of phototransduction activation and energy metabolism in stimulus-activated retinal photoreceptors.

A custom-designed OCT was employed for depth-resolved IOS imaging in mouse retina activated by a visible light flicker stimulation. The spatiotemporal properties of the IOS changes at the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) and inner segment (IS) were quantitatively evaluated. Rapid IOS change was observed at the OS almost right away, and the IOS at the IS was relatively slow. Comparative analysis indicates that the OS-IOS reflects transient OS deformation caused by the phototransduction activation, and IS-IOS might reflect the energy metabolism caused by mitochondria activation in retinal photoreceptors.

The consistency of the distribution of the IS-IOS and the 2nd OCT band supports the IS ellipsoid (ISe), which has abundant mitochondria, as the signal source of the 2nd OCT band of the outer retina. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This study provides valuable insights into the potential use of IOS imaging for concurrent ORG of phototransduction activation and energy metabolism in stimulus-activated retinal photoreceptors. It also sheds light on the anatomic correlate of the second outer retina band in OCT.
